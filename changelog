v1.2 - 2021-05-24
- Battery optimisations: set the GSM modem in low power mode when in deep sleep (forgot about this in the initial release). Gives a battery time of up to 10 days with regular use (increase of 4 days of deep sleep compared to earlier releases).
- Fixed issue where an SMS not providing the correct password would clear the phone number of the recieved message.
- Added SMS command for enabling continious GPS sending mode.
- Added SMS command for changing the time interval between sending GPS locations.
- Added SMS commands for setting the device in a shut-down state and waking it up again.
- Added a timer component to the "idle" SMS command.
- Updated the "idle" SMS command to work as a variant of deep sleep (with movement interrupts).

v1.1 - 2021-05-01
- Fixed an issue with the GPRS date/time comparison against the compile date/time. Apparently the Arduino compile date variable (__DATE__) adds an extra space whenever a date is a singel digit number (to keep the string length consistent, I assume). That breaks stuff if you don't compensate for it...
- Fixed "Deep Sleep" SMS command so that it's possible to set a custom wakeup time without issue.
- Added additional SMS-alerts to help with automating notification sounds on your phone (using Tasker or similar).
- Improved some SMS messages to be more informative.

v1.0 - 2021-04-27
- Initial release
